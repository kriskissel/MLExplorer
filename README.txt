ML Explorer is a Java application for demonstrating some of the
basic ideas in Machine Learning.  It illustrates the convergence 
behavior of learning algorithms such as the Perceptron and k-Means 
Clustering. There are also several demos that illustrate concepts such
as the bias-variance tradeoff and the effects of regularization on
linear regression.  

Plans for future additions include animations of
gradient descent and the phenomenon of overfitting.  In particular, I
would like to illustrate how including higher-order features can lead
to overfitting with logistic regression.  

Other future plans include
cleaning up the code by replacing the text-based messages being sent
between view and controller with a set of enums and replacing the
hard-coded data used in the animations with external resources, probably
in JSON, that will make it easier to edit and maintain.
